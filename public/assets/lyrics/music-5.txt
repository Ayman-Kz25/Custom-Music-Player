You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?

Another star, 
you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us 
alight ...

Where are you now? 🎵

Where are you now? 🎵

Where are you now? 🎵

Was it all in my fantasy? 🎵

Where are you now? 🎵

Were you only imaginary? 🎵

Where are you now? 

🎵🎵🎵🎵

Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea 🎵

Where are you now? 
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, ... 🎵
I'm faded ... 🎵
So lost, I'm faded, ... 🎵
I'm faded ... 🎵
So lost, I'm faded ... 🎵

These shallow waters never met 
what I needed ...
I'm letting go, 
a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing, 
alive ... 🎵

Where are you now? 🎵

Where are you now? 🎵

Under the bright 
but faded lights
You set my heart on fire

Where are you now? 🎵

Where are you now? 🎵

Where are you now?

🎵🎵🎵🎵

Atlantis, under the sea, under the sea

Where are you now? 🎵
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded, ... 🎵
I'm faded ... 🎵
So lost, I'm faded, ... 🎵
I'm faded ... 🎵
So lost, I'm faded 

... 🎵
